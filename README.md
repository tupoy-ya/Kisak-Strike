# Original README.md

# Kisak-Strike
Kisak-Strike: Gentoo Offensive(KSGO) is a CSGO port aimed towards Linux enthusiasts.

# Current Building Steps

```
Attention!

Kisak-Strike will build into folder ../game/
Make sure you clone this repo inside an existing folder!
```

Kisak-Strike uses CMake, the following sections will provide more information.

If you want to build with VPC for an authentic experience(not recommended), see https://gist.github.com/LWSS/9d2cd3205d197545d64fd27ee897fd53 for a rough draft from around when this project started.

 #### Basic Usage
```
cd ./cmake-build
cmake .. <VARIOUS OPTIONS HERE>
make -j<NUM_THREADS>
```
## POSTBUILD - Acquire Original Game Files
Use Depot Downloader( https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader ) with your steam account. The depotdownloader built-into Steam was broken earlier this year and this is the only option currently.
```
CSGO SteamAppID: 730
CSGO Assets: DepotID: 731 ManifestID: 7043469183016184477
Windows Binaries: DepotID: 732 4047004309608881181
Linux Binaries: Depot ID: 734 4197642562793798650
```

* Copy over all files from the 731 assets depot (manifest: 7043469183016184477)
* Copy over *only needed* files from the 734 linux binary depot (manifest: 4197642562793798650)
    * ./bin/map_publish/* - (FOLDER which seems to contain some vgui assets)
    * ./csgo.sh
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/libphonon3d.so -- If you want HRTF 3D sound
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/vphysics_client.so -- If you want Valve-Original physics engine. (It runs a bit better than the rebuild, but is closed-source)
    * [OPTIONAL]./game/bin/linux64/scaleformui_client.so -- If you want the ScaleformUI for some reason.

## POSTBUILD - Acquire Additional Kisak-Strike Files
Head over to the Files Repo: https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike-Files
These belong inside of your `../game/` folder.


## Current Nonfree blobs
* ${LIBPUBLIC}/libsteam_api.so  - Left for Convenience, can be removed in the future.

## Launch
`./csgo_linux64`
